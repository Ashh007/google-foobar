# Google Foobar
In September when I was Googling something I got hit by a werid message inviting me to try some programming challenges. I worked on the various problems for several days. I have attempted to gather my code and the prompts for your viewing pleasure.

I urge you **not** to use this code as your own. Plagiarism is not an honorable thing to do nor is it smart when you're sending a search engine your code.

These solutions are far from perfect and some took several hours over the course of several days to come to fruition. I'm going to go back and document all my code at some point so that I can better understand what I did.

On a couple of these I forgot the names and on the first I forgot to copy my code before I submitted it so it's lost to time.

Enjoy!
